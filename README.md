# Stopwatch App

Here is a simple Stopwatch App that I built using Flutter.
My UI is inspired by [Rahmat Raditya](https://dribbble.com/shots/11164774-Clock-Apps-Design-Exploration)

## How to run the app

Step 1: Install Flutter on your machine
Step 2: Clone the repo
Step 3: From your VS code terminal run the following

```
flutter run
````

Step 4: Next pick a device to emulate the app (You can also install Android Studio and emulate your app on Android devices such as Pixel 4)
